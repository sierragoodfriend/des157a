        <p>Players: 2<br>
            Goal: Be the first player to score 50+ points</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Player 1 rolls the dice to start.</li>
            <li>
                There are two conditions that can harm Player 1:
                <ul>
                    <li>If either die is a one, Player 1 loses all points gained in that round, and it becomes Player 2's turn.</li>
                    <li>If both dice are a one (snake eyes), Player 1 loses their entire accumulated score, and it becomes Player 2's turn.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If neither of these conditions occur, the total of the dice will be added to Player 1's score for that round.</li>
            <li>
                Player 1 can then choose to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Roll again OR</li>
                    <li>Pass their turn, keeping the points gathered so far that round and adding them to their total score</li>
                </ul>
                Repeat steps 1-3 until Player 1 decides to stop rolling or rolls a one.
            </li>
            <li>After Player 1 finishes their turn, Player 2 takes their turn following the same rules.</li>
        </ol>
