        <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
        <p>
            I had 6 of my peers and/or housemates play my GameOn studio 3 game with one another (2 people at a time).
        </p>

        <p>
            I only user tested on people who have never looked at or played my game before and I didn't tell them anything about the game itself. I observed their gameplay, and asked them these questions afterwards:
        </p>

        <p class="questionsStyles">
            "What did you think of the game overall? Did you enjoy playing it?"
        </p>

        <p class="questionsStyles">
            "Was the gameplay clear? Did you have any trouble understanding what was going on?"
        </p>

        <p class="questionsStyles">
            "Was the website easy to navigate? Was there anything you noticed wasn't working correctly, or that was confusing in terms of navigation or instruction?"
        </p>

        <p class="questionsStyles">
            "Do you have any ideas for how I can make user experiences in this game better?"
        </p>

        <p>
            The feedback I recieved was incredibly helpful. As mentioned before in previous critiques, almost every user strongly advocated for a "current score display" of sorts, so that users can know what their score will be if they pass without having to do that math themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            My friend Eva suggested that I have the "passing score" in the same place as the player score, slightly expanding and contrasting, and perhaps in a bold color like red. I like that idea and will experiment with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another helpful critque is that the rules are clear, but very lenghty for such a simple game. I mentioned at this point that I'm considering having a tutorial option. All of the users agreed that this would be helpful, and believe I should replace the rules button with a tutorial option.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving forward, I want gameplay to be as clear, simple, and easy as possible. The game itself is rather simple, but it's surprising how much work it takes to make a simple game effective and easy to understand. The tutorial idea is a little daunting, but I believe I can do it!
