        <h3>Form Design</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Salim Ansari's article, "Best practices for form design", has a lot of useful insights and tips for helping developers design user friendly forms.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    There were so many tips that I found to be incredibly helpful, especially for encourageing form completion. For example, Ansari emphasizes the "less is more" principle – developers should only be asking for & including essential information on a form. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When a form is too crowded with information, or hard to navigate, I personally find myself being discouraged from filling it out. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Likewise, Ansari points out how the use of percentage complete bar or a form completion tracker of some kind can encourage usability. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forms are usually not exciting or fun to fill out, and allowing users to know how close they are to the end (eliminating the uncertainty that the form will go on forever...) can keep a user going until the form is finished. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A form that I used recently that is very user friendly is the DMV Drivers License Replacement Form... Although I did unfortunately  have to lose my DL in order to come across this example ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This form is fairly short & to the point, easy to navigate, and it has good formatting, spatial awareness, and a neat and sequential order!
                </p>
