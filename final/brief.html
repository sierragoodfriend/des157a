    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>GameOn Project</h2>
        <p>
            I'll be expanding on my GameOn project for the final assignment because I've put a great deal of work into it so far and have clear ideas for how I want to move forward with it.
        </p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            In the final project, I plan to improve upon the UI & UX. Ideally, I'd like to make a tutorial for the game itself, either when you click on a tutorial button, or when you start the game for the first time (with a skip option).
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd like to add in more elements that guide teh user along in gameplay â€“ like +__ to the player score so that players understand that their round score will be added to their total score.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I want to work on adjusting spacing so that everything in the game has clear visual heirarchy! 
        </p>

        <h2>Expert feedback</h2>
        <p>
            I'll be sharing my ideas with people who are outside of the field of design. I want to user test with someone who enjoys playing video games, and then with somebody who has little to no experience gaming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that this strategy for user testing will get me good feedback and allow me to assess how clear the gameplay and overall website is.
        </p>
